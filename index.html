                    <p>
                        <em>Abdul Sattar Edhi (1928-2016)</em> was a revered Pakistani humanitarian, philanthropist, and
                        social worker, widely celebrated for his dedication to helping the poor and needy. Born in
                        Bantva, Gujarat, British India, he migrated to Pakistan after its creation in 1947. Edhi's early
                        experiences with illness and poverty in his family deeply influenced his lifelong commitment to
                        social service.

                        In 1951, he founded the Edhi Foundation in Karachi, starting with a small dispensary. The
                        foundation grew into Pakistan's largest and most respected welfare organization, offering a wide
                        range of services including emergency medical care, orphanages, shelters for the homeless, and
                        rehabilitation centers for drug addicts and mentally ill individuals. The Edhi Foundation also
                        runs the largest fleet of private ambulances in the world, providing free emergency transport.

                        Edhi's work was characterized by his simple lifestyle, unwavering principles, and dedication to
                        humanitarianism regardless of race, religion, or nationality. He received numerous awards and
                        honors for his service, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 1986. Despite
                        his international acclaim, he remained humble, often rejecting offers of government assistance
                        to ensure the independence and integrity of his foundation.

                        Abdul Sattar Edhi passed away on July 8, 2016, leaving behind a legacy of compassion,
                        selflessness, and an enduring impact on humanitarian efforts in Pakistan and beyond. His life
                        and work continue to inspire millions around the world.
